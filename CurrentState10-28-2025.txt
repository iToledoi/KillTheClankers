I am proud of several aspects of my game, but most importantly the behavior of Enemies as I spent the most time on that.
I used the Navmesh tools to help path the enmemies to the player at all times and stop once they are in firing range to 
shoot at the Player.
I am also proud of the special attack ability where you can push back objects using the force including enemies and their
projectiles that when colliding back at them, will kill them.

As I made the 2D project, there were some features that I did not implement from the original write up.
I did not incorporate the player's choice to choose either a melee weapon or ranged weapon as I stuck the player 
with the melee sword due to time constraints. So none of the player's ranged weapon abilities were implemented either.
I decided to keep the gameplay HUD simple and only included the number of enemies killed while leaving out specific cooldowns.

Even though I did not implement some of these features, I wrote my code with these features in mind later down the line
to be easily implemented with more time. 
One of the features that I did not include in the write up was creating variety of enemy types because I knew the limitations 
of making this game in a month but did include the bones of that feature for future implementation.
